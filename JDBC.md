# JDBC

## Overview

**The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API provides universal data access from the Java programming language**. Using the JDBC API, you can access any **virtual data source**, from the relational database to spreadsheets and flat files. JDBC technology also provides a common base on which tools and alternate interfaces can be built.

The JDBC API is comprised of two packages:

- java.sql
- javax.sql

> You automatically get both packages when downloading the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE) 8.

To use the JDBC API with a particular database management system, *you need a JDBC technology-based driver to mediate between JDBC technology and the database.*

 The JDBC library includes APIs for each of the tasks mentioned below that are commonly associated with database usage.

- Making a connection to a database.
- Creating SQL or MySQL statements.
- Executing SQL or MySQL queries in the database.
- Viewing & Modifying the resulting records.
