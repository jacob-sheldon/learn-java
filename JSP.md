# JSP

Java Server Pages (JSP) is a **server-side programming technology** that enables the creation of **dynamic, platform-independent** methods for building Web-based applications. 

JavaServer Pages are **built on top of the Java Servlets API**, so like Servlets, JSP also has access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, including **JDBC, JNDI, EJB, JAXP,** etc.
